      <h2 class="about">SUKHOI SU-57</h2>
      <h6>Monday, March 22</h6>
    <p>Su-57 is a multifunctional fighter of the 5th generation designed to destroy all kinds of air targets in long-range and close combat, defeat of ground, surface targets of the enemy with overcoming enemy air defense systems, monitoring of airspace at large distances from the base, destruction of the enemy's air operations control system.</p>
    <p>The Su-57 is equipped with a brand-new complex of deeply integrated avionics with an open architecture, with a high level of control automation and intelligent support for the crew with the possibility of expansion and modernization. Implementing an open architecture greatly reduces the load on the pilot and allows you to concentrate on performing tactical tasks.</p>
    <p> One of the features of the Su-57 is the wide use in the design of the glider composite materials. On the one hand, such structures have high weight performance when working in conditions of complex loading. On the other hand, the technology of making cellular panels has been mastered by production, which has allowed to reduce the level of risk, significantly expand the scope of the use of composite materials and bring the overall percentage of PKM in the design of the Su-57 to 24%. In addition, the use of large panels has significantly reduced the workload of assembly work.

        <a href="https://www.sukhoi.org/products/samolety/410/">Here!</a> The Su-57 uses a new emergency escape system to save the pilot in emergency situations in the entire range of altitudes and speeds.</p>
    <p>The aircraft has implemented a new approach to maintenance (TO) of the aircraft due to:
        <ul>
            <li>Adaptation of the aircraft's TO system to the operating conditions adopted by the Customer</li>
            <li>Optimization of the types of TO and frequency of their implementation with the exception of regulatory work and replacement of overhaul control and restoration work</li>
            <li>Use of built-in controls in all types of TO</li>   
            <li>Preparing the aircraft for flights by one aircraft technician with a connection</li>
        </ul>
